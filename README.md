## Abstract 

TalkieTalky is a platform for film fanatics and TV devotees who have a burning urge to share their thoughts on what they just watched. By using TalkieTalky, fans are now able to talk about all of their favorite movies and shows without having to navigate to multiple websites or applications. Our platform will help avid movie-goers keep up with the latest TV shows and films through the use of the Discover tab, discussion boards, and movie and show-specific communities. Users are able to easily plan the movies and shows they want to watch in the future, as well as track their progress and mark what they have already seen. The website is designed to mimic the layout and design of a streaming service in order to make the experience as seamless as possible for our users.
